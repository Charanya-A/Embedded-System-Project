# Real-Time LPG Leakage Detection System using MQ-5 sensor and Arduino UNO
Designed a real-time LPG leakage detection system using an MQ-5 sensor and Arduino UNO. The system monitors gas levels and sends SMS/calls via a GSM module. Integrated a servo motor for automatic gas shutoff. Developed and tested for reliability in residential/industrial settings with real-time LCD display monitoring.
